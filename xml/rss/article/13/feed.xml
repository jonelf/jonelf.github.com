      <title>Randomly chosen OTPs defaced</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/articles/2007/02/05/trojans-and-one-time-passwords#comments"&gt;Gunnar  Kreitz&lt;/a&gt; has shown that random chosen OTPs aren't nearly as good as I first thought. Against the current trojan they work just fine but Kreitz describes how a modified and more advanced trojan could be effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that in the end the protocol only forces the trojan be more complex, adds a time span for the validity of the OTP and makes the attack more likely to fail (there is no guarantee that the user will enter a second OTP or that he will do it in time). I suppose the attacker also would have to make the trojan completely automated or have a 24/7 staff waiting. If the user has opted in to have the &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; presented as a CAPTCHA it would force the evildoers to have that 24/7 staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Advantages:&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
A TTL (time to live) for OTPs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demands more resources and higher complexity from the attacker.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A little harder to use (finding the challenged OTP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In theory not that much more secure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My bank has support for sending OTPs by SMS but a trojan that works like the one described by Kreitz would have no problem with that one either.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protection against phising, as in redirecting the user to a fake login page, is still much greater with randomly chosen OTPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it a bit ironic that the bank in question actually is going to implement something that sounds like &lt;i&gt;randomly chosen OTPs&lt;/i&gt;. They recently announced a change in their login procedure: 
&lt;cite&gt;"Vilken engångskod från kodkortet du ska använda framgår på inloggningssidan." / "What one-time password you are  supposed to enter will be presented on the login page."&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Personally I think the security tokens with signing abilities sounds more and more reasonable.
&lt;/p&gt;
