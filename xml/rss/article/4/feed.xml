      <title>Who's that girl?</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So who's Alice? If you found this blog because of your interest in computer security it's a good chance that you already knew that in cryptography &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob"&gt;Alice, Bob &lt;/a&gt;and Mallory are often used as placeholders for common actors in different scenarios.
I guess it's simpler to remember Alice and Bob than "The sender A wants to identify itself to receiver B" and alike. Alice usually wants to send data to Bob. If there exists an eavesdropper she is  often called Eve. Mallory is a more dangerous animal than Eve because he has control over Alice's messages in such a way that he can change or resend then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first posting I had in mind for this blog involved Alice, Bob and Mallory and suddenly the blog had a name. &lt;strike&gt;That "article" isn't quite finished yet.&lt;/strike&gt; Now &lt;a href="/articles/2007/02/05/trojans-and-one-time-passwords"&gt;it&lt;/a&gt; is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog will most certainly not be about IT Security alone. I have been known to post some &lt;a href="http://plea.se/me/http2ftp.html"&gt;Ruby-snippets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://plea.se/me/validatePnum.html"&gt;JavaScripts&lt;/a&gt; and such in the past and will try to keep that up.&lt;/p&gt;
